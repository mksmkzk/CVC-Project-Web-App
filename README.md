# CVC Project Web App

## Introduction

We are trying to design a full stack web app that will modernize the workflow of CVC.

## Structure and Description of the purpose.

We will have hopefully continue developing the new website and add an employeee portal to the app.

The idea is to have the user create an account through an email invite link made specifically for that person.
The first screen will be the login screen.

### User Structure
- Name
- Email
- Password
- Division #
- Crew Name/Number
- Position ? 

Once the user logs in, we will be taken to a dashboard that has the following information.

### Links
- Map of Jobs
- Messageboard for their crew and/or division
- Submit Change Order (Field Manager / Supervisor?)
- Submit Field Measurements (Field Manager / Supervisor?)
- Submit Time Sheets

All of the submittions will have the option to either upload an image or fill out a form.
For uploading an image, we will upload it to the corresponding dropbox location.
Once the image is uploaded or the form is submitted. We will send an email to each person who needs to see it.

### Structure of each Submit
- Form or Uploaded Image
- Department that needs that specific data
  - List of emails:
    - HR, Payroll, Supervisor for Timecards (?)
    - Starts Coordinators, AR, Supervisors for Change Orders (?)
    - Starts Coordinators, AR, Supervisors for Field Measurements (?)
    
We will be going through incoming jobs and then filter them by the following.

### Filtering Job Data

As each point of data is added on, it will require the following information:
- Division
- Job Code
- Subjob
- Crew
- Start Date (?)
- Orders

### Structure or each Order
- Job Code
  - Subjob
    - Subjob
    - Order Date
      - Type of Order (Concrete / Pumping / )
      - Contents
